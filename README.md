## ðŸ“Š Strategy Logic  

### ðŸ“¥ **Entry Conditions** (Buying)  
A **long trade** is entered when:  
- **RSI â‰¥ 50** (momentum turning bullish)  
- **MACD Histogram increasing** (bullish trend confirmation)  
- **Price forming a higher high**  
- **Close above Support**  
- **Price above 20-MA but below 100-MA** (pullback opportunity)  
- **Volume increasing**  

### ðŸ“¤ **Exit Conditions** (Selling)  
A **long position** is exited when:  
- Stop-loss is hit  
- Price faces **rejection at resistance** or **100-MA**  
- **High-volume red candles appear**  
- Price fails to hold above **20-MA or Support**  

Similar logic applies for **short trades** (reverse conditions).
